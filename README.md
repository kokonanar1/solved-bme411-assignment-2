For instance, we can supply the gradient in the user subroutine and avoid the possibly expensive automatic divided difference scheme (the default) by switching on the corresponding feature as

<strong>options</strong>=<strong>optimset(’GradObj’, ‘on’)</strong>

<em>fminunc </em>is then executed using the command

<strong>[Xopt,fopt,iflag,output] </strong>= <strong>fminunc(’testfun’, X, options)</strong>

with a subroutine getfun that provides the analytical gradient in the vector DF as

<strong>function [f, Df] </strong>= <strong>getfun(X)</strong>

<strong>f </strong>= <strong>…</strong>

<strong>Df(1) </strong>= <strong>…; Df(2) </strong>= <strong>…; Df(N) </strong>= <strong>…;</strong>
